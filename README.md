The Team Spectral mod manager is a tiny mod, with very simple, but useful, abilities. It checks an online file (hosted here on GitHub), looking for updates. If there is an update, the update will be automatically installed to the client's mod folder, or notify the player if he has auto-installation turned off.

This mod's development will start in a while. We will be creating a new version of it after that, which lets you do the same things, but with a lot more control. That might be very useful for modpack ceators and such.
